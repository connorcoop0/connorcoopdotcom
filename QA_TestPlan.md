# QA Test Plan â€“ AWS Portfolio Site

## Overview

This test plan covers a personal portfolio website deployed on AWS using:

- S3 and CloudFront for static hosting
- Route 53 for the domain
- API Gateway and Lambda for the backend
- DynamoDB for storing visitor data

The goal is to check that the site loads correctly and that the backend works as expected.
